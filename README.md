# Benchmark of ReLU and SELU activation function
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown an excellent performance in computer vision task. Applications of CNN include image classification, image semantic segmentation, object detection in images, etc.This project will observe 4 different choice of hyperparameter on their effect to CNN with ReLU and SELU as activation function
